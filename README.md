# Email Clone Application
This is an app that replicates someone getting onto their email account. It then allows that user to see all previously sent emails (and who the recipient of that email was, as well as the body of the email), or compose a new email.

## Instructions for use
The app is incredibly simplistic to use. Just click whatever blue link you see to view previously sent emails, or click on a button to add / 'send' a new email!
